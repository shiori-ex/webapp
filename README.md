shiori is a web application to simply store, manage and search through links by meta variables like description or tags. [MeiliSearch](https://www.meilisearch.com/) is used therefore as high-performance full-text search database to provide blazingly fast search results even in huge datasets. The dataset will be accessable over a REST API via web or CLI application.
